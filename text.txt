Do you like programming ?
If yes, you should be interesting by github to manage your code versions.
I would is github with:
1/ A main branch
2/ A beta branch
3/ Several branchs below the beta to develop beta brnach functionnalities. After testing those branch could be integrated into the main branch.
Let's try if it works !
